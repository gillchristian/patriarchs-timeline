# patriarchs timeline

this is a simple app I made to learn the basic principles of React + Flux architecture. Also I started to use ES6, JSX, Webpack and Babel.

the work is actually not complete but I will make further development of the patriachs and bible characters timeline using D3 since is a better aproach for handling this kind of data.

for now you can visit the project [here](http://gillchristian.github.io/patriarchs-timeline).
